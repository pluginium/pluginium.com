Google Chrome is a fast, secure, and widely-used web browser developed by Google, known for its simplicity and efficiency. It offers features like tabbed browsing, synchronization across devices, an extensive library of extensions, and built-in Google services integration. Chrome also prioritizes user safety with frequent updates, sandboxing technology, and advanced phishing and malware protection.

Google Chrome extensions are small software programs that users can install to customize and enhance their browsing experience. These extensions add additional functionality to the browser, such as ad-blocking, productivity tools, social media integration, and more, allowing users to tailor Chrome to their specific needs and preferences.
