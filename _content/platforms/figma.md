Figma is a collaborative interface design tool used by designers to create, prototype, and collaborate on digital designs in real-time. It offers features like cloud-based storage, live collaboration, version history tracking, and a wide range of design capabilities, making it popular among design teams for its efficiency and flexibility. Figma allows designers to work seamlessly across different platforms and devices, streamlining the design process from conception to final product.

Figma plugins are small add-on programs that extend the functionality of the Figma design tool, offering additional features and integrations to streamline workflows and enhance productivity. These plugins cover various aspects of the design process, including accessibility, animation, prototyping, and asset management, empowering users to customize their design environment and optimize their workflow according to their specific needs.
